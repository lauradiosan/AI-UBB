input:

first line: number of cities (n)
second line: distances between the first city and all the other cities (n real values)
third line: distances between the second city and all the other cities (n real values)
...
n + 1 line: distances between the n-th city and all the other cities (n real values)
index of source city
index of destination city

solution:
first line: number of cities (n)
second line: the optimal traversing path that visits all the cities (indexes of cities, starting by 1)
third line: the value of the optimal path through all the cities (real value)
fourth line: the length (in number of cities) of the optimal path from the source city to the destination city
fifth line: the optimal traversing path from the source city to the destination city (indexes of cities, starting by source city and ending by destination city)
sixth line: the value of the optimal path from the source city to the destination city
